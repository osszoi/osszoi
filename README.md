### Hello world 👋, I'm a senior frontend engineer with over `now-2009` years of experience in web development
Passionate about crafting elegant solutions and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

```ts
// @no-const/because-we're-always-evolving
let about = {
  code: [Javascript, Typescript, HTML, CSS, Python],
  tools: [React, Angular, Sass, Storybook, ...await fetch('mostcommontools')],
  getCountry: (from = 'Venezuela') => {
    return 'Spain';
  },
  basic: [...SRE, ...Backend, ...Arquitect],
  food: {
    pizza: !vegetables,
    alfredoPasta: !!'always'
  },
  music: {
    martinGarrix: !+'x',
    ...rest
  },
  printHobbies: () =>
    console.log(['code', 'videogames', 'drive', 'math'].join(', ')),
};

export default eduardo = { status: 'coding', ...about }
```

_Always evolving, always curious, and always hungry for pizza. 🍕_
